### About me
I graduated from university with a degree in mining engineering in 2019. I worked in a small firm as an engineer, I made drawings and developed documentation for projects.

I decided to self-teach myself and become a front-end developer because almost a year ago I made a photo album site for myself with photos from my life and I really liked it. I started to learn more about front-end development, read various books such as "Head first html css" "You don't know about JS" and various documentations about JS language.

At the moment I'm actively looking job as a front-end developer, making pet-projects and trying learn and grow up my hard skills.

### Hard skills
- JS(ES6), TypeScript
- React(v.16+), Redux(thunk, saga, toolkit)
- HTML, CSS(sass/less, styled-components)
- GIT, Figma
- VS Code, Intellij IDEA

### My code
**Find the unique number**


There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
```
function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){
  const arr = []
  arr.push(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8)
  return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(arr.map((num) => num*num).reduce((curr, prev) => curr+prev, 0))/2)
}
```
